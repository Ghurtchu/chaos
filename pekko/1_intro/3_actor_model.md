Below we highlight how the actor model addresses the shortcomings of traditional programming approaches in modern, distributed systems. By focusing on communication between cooperative entities rather than shared state and locking mechanisms, the actor model provides a principled solution that aligns with our mental model of system behavior.

Key points include:
- Message passing: Actors communicate by sending messages, allowing them to delegate work without blocking. Messages do not return a value (fire and forget principle), facilitating non-blocking execution and efficient resource utilization.
- Encapsulation: Actors process messages sequentially, preserving encapsulation without the need for locks. Each actor maintains its own state and reacts to messages independently, eliminating races and ensuring thread safety.
- Error handling: Error situations are gracefully handled through message passing and supervision hierarchies. Actors can reply with error messages, and supervisors can decide how to react to failures, including restarting or stopping actors.

Overall, the actor model offers a simple yet powerful abstraction for building distributed systems, promoting fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.
