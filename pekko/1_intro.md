Apache Pekko is an open-source library suite designed for building scalable, resilient distributed systems.

It abstracts away low-level concerns like concurrency and networking, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

Pekko addresses challenges such as component crashes, message loss, and network latency fluctuations common in modern architectures.

Key features include multi-threaded behavior without low-level concurrency constructs, transparent remote communication, and a clustered, high-availability architecture that scales on demand. Pekko leverages the actor model for easier development of correct concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems, providing tight integration across its libraries for efficient problem-solving in a unified programming model.
